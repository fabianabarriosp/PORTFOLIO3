                <p>We brainstormed ideas of what things compose a brand, based on that, we specified concepts to create our own studio.</p>

                  We had a HCD workshop where we identified problems people face when eating chips and came up with possible (some already existing) solutions. I made this concept map with the ideas my group and I discussed to represent it in a more visual way. This activity is loosely aligned with the double diamond method as we followed this framework in a small scale. This activity influenced the re branding of our studio from Beyond to Slaygency. Through empathy mapping and more brainstorming,  we realized we wanted a brand that’s bold, fun, and unapologetically us.</p>

              <p>We wanted our studio name to align with its mission, create something deeper than just visuals, to go beyond brand aesthetics and build real, meaningful connections between a brand and the people. For that, all group members unanimously agreed on the name “Beyond”, as it aligns with our brands main core values : innovation, trust, quality, and reliability. I sketched my initial ideas of possible logo options. I later tested variations in color, size, and shape to find a balance between clarity, professionalism, and creativity.</p>

                Several teachers expressed their opinions of lack of identity of our studio, it was boring and bland, even though we met all the requirements. As a group, we decided to re-brand and create something bold and unforgettable.</p>

                <p>I was playing it safe with the first designs. Keeping it basic to fit a wider range of possible clients. As a group we soon realized to stand out we have to put ourselves out there and really just be ourselfs. During this phase of the project we´ve had several presentations to all our semester mates to show our progress during the weeks, even though at the beginning i dreaded it, it helped me be more confident to show my work in front of other people. Re-branding from Beyond to Slaygency helped that confidence as the branding was truly something i felt proud to show and i think everyone also could feel that through my presentation. This project also helped me work on decision making within a group, we dialogued and worked together to find a middle ground whenever we didn't agree on something.</p>
